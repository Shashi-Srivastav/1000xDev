<!-- This code demonstrates a sum calculator which takes 2 inputs and outputs the sum. -->
<!-- For the input, we have 2 input fields of type number where user enters the numbers. -->
<!-- Next, there's a button which when clicked, should display the sum. -->
<!-- These 3 fields currently demonstrate a static website because there's no logic involved of finding sum and showing it. -->
<!-- Static site means there's no change in the content. -->
<!-- To make it dynamic, some operations need to be done. -->
<!-- 1. Reading values from the input fields. -->
<!-- 2. Applying logic to add these values. -->
<!-- 3. Showing the output value to user on site once button is clicked. -->
<!-- 4. Each time an input value is changed, the sum should also change. -->

<!-- To apply these dynamic operations on HTML elements, we use DOM(Document Object Model). -->
<!-- It is a web API provided by the browser. It is not part of JS or ECMASCRIPT. -->
<!-- DOM represents the HTML document as a tree-like structure. It allows JS to interact with HTML documents. -->
<!-- The document node is the root of the tree, and it contains child nodes such as the head, body, etc. -->
<!-- DOM provides a way to access and manipulate its elements using JS. -->
<!-- JS provides various methods to access DOM elements. Once we have access to DOM elements, we can manipulate them in various ways. -->

<!-- To access elements, we need to provide them class or id. -->
<!-- Class helps to access multiple elements at once. Using class, we can easily manipulate multiple elements. -->
<!-- Id works as a unique identifier. Using id, we can only access and manipulate a single element. -->

<!-- For the sum calculator, lets assign ids to each input and put them inside a div. Assign the div a class. -->
<!-- Here assigning ids to input is better because the input values can be different. So we will have to access them individually. -->
<!-- Assigning class to div is just to show some operations on the class element. -->

<!-- Create a JS function where we will access the DOM elements and apply logic to find the sum. -->
<!-- To access any element with a specific id, JS provides .getElementById() method. -->
<!-- To get the value of the input, use the .value property. The value will be a string to parse it into integer. -->
<!-- Get the sum by adding both the input values. -->
<!-- Next, create a div and give an id. This div we will use to show output on site. -->
<!-- After the sum is calculated, we access the div with its id using .getElementById() method and then inject HTML into it using .innerHTML property. -->
<!-- This property is to append new contents to an element. -->

<!-- Call the JS function when the button is clicked using the attribute onClick. -->

<!-- The CSS applied is just an operation to showcase the use of class and id. -->
